That's where the BookDoctors website comes in. Here all the successful book doctors of the world can come to share their go-to book prescriptions for the variety of ailments they routinely see. Then, aspiring book doctors can come to access the wealth of literary remedies prescribed by the best book doctors around!</p>
    <p className="regular">So come explore the prescriptions here and find the remedies for what ails your friends, or even yourself! Or even better, stay a while and add some of the books that have changed your life. Share some prescriptions--novels that have gotten you through tough places.</p>
    <p className="regular">NOTE: BookDoctors is still in its infancy, so many of our planned features don't work yet. Be patient, and in the coming weeks it will all take shape. What we need right now more than anything is a great database of books, so please do click that New Book link up above and add your favorite book!</p>
    <p className="regular">NOTE THE SECOND: If you registered for the site a few days ago and ran into errors in creating book entries (either no books created, or double entries) please clear your cache, which you can do by deleting your browsing history for the past week or so. This will force your browser to use our latest code rather than what it had stored in its cache.
